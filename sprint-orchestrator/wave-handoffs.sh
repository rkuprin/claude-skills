# wave-handoffs.sh — render one wave's ready-to-paste kickoffs into a single file.
#
#   wave-handoffs.sh docs/sprints/<sprint> <wave>
#
# Emits, to stdout, a Markdown document with:
#   - a recap of the wave (one line per story: number, title, execution mode,
#     driver hint, and the first line of the story's Objective), and
#   - one fenced, ready-to-paste `agent-handoff` story-execution kickoff per
#     story in that wave, every value resolved from the story doc's frontmatter
#     and its `/goal` line.
#
# The kickoff shape mirrors agent-handoff/SKILL.md "Mode: story-execution" — that
# skill file is the source of truth; keep this template in sync with it.

# Redirect to a file to get the wave's single handoff sheet, e.g.:
